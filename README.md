🐶🐱 Task 3: Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

This task demonstrates a simple yet effective Machine Learning approach for image classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

📌 Objective:

Classify grayscale images of cats and dogs using image pixel values as input features — without deep learning, just pure ML.

🧠 Key Steps:

Load and preprocess image data (grayscale, resized to 64x64)

Flatten image pixels into feature vectors

Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model

Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification report
